UForm-Gen is a small generative vision-language model primarily designed for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering. The model was pre-trained on the internal image captioning dataset and fine-tuned on public instructions datasets: SVIT, LVIS, VQAs datasets.

## Usage

- Workers - TypeScript

## Parameters
`*`  indicates a required field

### Input

-   `0`: Binary string representing the image contents.
-   `1`
    -   `prompt`: The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.
    -   `raw`: If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.
    -   `top_p`: Controls the creativity of the AI's responses by adjusting how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.
    -   `top_k`: Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.
    -   `seed`: Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.
    -   `repetition_penalty`: Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.        
    -   `frequency_penalty`: Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.        
    -   `presence_penalty`: Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.
    -   `image`  required
        -   `0`: An array of integers that represent the image data constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values
            -   `items`: A value between 0 and 255
        -   `1`: Binary string representing the image contents.
    -   `max_tokens`  default 512
        The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
        

### Output
-   `description`
